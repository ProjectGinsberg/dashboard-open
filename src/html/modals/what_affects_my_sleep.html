	<p>We’ve looked at whether the data you’ve recorded seems correlated with other factors. If the magnitude of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">correlation</a> is over 0.8 we say that there’s a strong relationship. If it’s over 0.5 we say there’s a weak relationship. Otherwise we say there’s no relationship.</p>

	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">Correlation</a> is a simple measure of the relationship between two variables. It can easily fail to detect a more complicated relationship. Also a high correlation between two factors does not necessarily indicate that one factor is causing the other. They might, for example, be effects with a common cause.</p>
