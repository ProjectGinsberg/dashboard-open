Title: Ginsberg 1.8 released!

Alongside the usual bugfixes, we've added two major new features this release.

* Fine-grained data control: The revamped [Connections page](/#/connections) now offers much more fine-grained control over the data that Ginsberg will pull in from your connected services.
* Month-to-month sensor: The second is the 'Monthly Check-up' which you can use to gauge how you are month-to-month. It asks 6 simple questions about your wellbeing, and you can use it to get a broader understanding of how you're doing. Check out your notifications to get started.

As ever, we really value your feedback and would love to know what you think (good and bad!). You can get in touch via [hello@project-ginsberg.com](mailto://hello@project-ginsberg.com) or on our [uservoice page](http://projectginsberg.uservoice.com/).

Enjoy!

Team Ginsberg
