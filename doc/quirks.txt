- XDomain is used for CORS on IE9/10. It needs to be set up for every host you want to communicate with
- Rollbar defaults the environment to 'platform'. If you're seeing issue there it may indicate a problem occuring before rollbar has been setup.
- pointer-events:none doesn't work on IE9/10. The standard polyfill doesn't work either because it assumes the page contents are static.
